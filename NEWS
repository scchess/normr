CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.1
-------------------------

FEATURES
     o `summary()` output more concise
     o `getEnrichment()` takes `F` for specifying a desired foreground
         component for standardization of the enrichment
     o `iterations` argument allows running multiple fits with different
         starting values
     o T Filter threshold can now be specified with `minP` argument for less 
         stringent filtering
     o Added a normR overview scheme to the vignette
     o Qvalue computation improvement by specifying range for prop. of H_0

BUGFIXES
     o Fixed the erroneous tiling of supplied GR objects in char,char,GRanges
     o `diffR()` is more robust by doing a label-switched fit also

     o T Filter threshold is now controlled with the minP argument in main
       methods


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.6
-------------------------

FEATURES

       significance level

       enrichment

PERFORMANCE
     o SIMD optimization for OpenMP >= ver4


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.5
-------------------------

FEATURES
     o summary() for NormRFit instances of types "diffR" and "regimeR" now
       shows componentwise test results

BUGFIXES
     o Removing MAKEFLAG "-D_GLIBCXX_PARALLEL" because it is experimental


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.4
-------------------------

BUGFIXES
     o Removing PKG_CPPFLAGS and PKG_LIBS variables from src/Makevars


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.3
-------------------------

BUGFIXES
     o Fixing imports in roxygen2


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.2
-------------------------

FEATURES
     o Vignette finished
     o Documentation for NormRFit-class & NormRCountConfig-class updated

BUGFIXES
     o deploy.log removed


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.1
-------------------------

FEATURES
     o  Added examples for normr-methods, BamCountConfig-class & NormRFit-class
     o  Moved all documentation to one manpage (normr.Rd)
     o  Vignette: knitr-based vignette for normr finished
     o  exportR(): Export NormRFit objects to bed, bedGraph and bigWig
     o  plot(): Produce a small diagnostic plot for NormRFit objects
     o  diffR(): Intersection of results for switched labels increases
        specificity

BUGFIXES
     o  Removed deploy.log
     o  Fixed build errors and warnings
     o  Fixed failing test


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.0
-------------------------

FEATURES

     o  huge performance speedup by data compression to unique tupels only
     o  Kahan summation for log posterior summation to reduce numerical error
     o  Standardized enrichment computation in C++. This enrichment can be well
        compared between various ChIP-seq experiments
     o  exportR() function provides methods to export results of fits as a
        region bed file or bigWig track of standardized enrichment
